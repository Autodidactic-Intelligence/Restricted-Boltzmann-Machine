# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine
An implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Tested using the MNIST Digit dataset and implementated to the best of my abilities with success using basic matrix operations. It is able to use both contrastive divergence and persistent contrastive divergence, and can do supervised learning as well.
